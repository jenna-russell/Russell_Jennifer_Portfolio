# Jennifer Russell's Data Science Portfolio

This is a public portfolio of my data science work. Most of my work has specialized in Natural Language
Processing, so the projects in this repo will mostly reflect that. I also have experience in data
visualization, and included such a project to reflect the high degree of importance I feel about having 
solid data storytelling skills and how much of the value in our work as Data Scientists is not only from 
the models we can build but also how we can create an impact through the presentation of our work.
